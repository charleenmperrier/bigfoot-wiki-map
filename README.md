Bigfoot Tracking Map
=======
Are you tired of going on a vacation and having nothing to do? Has hiking in the woods alone lost it lustre after fighting a bear and winning? During that fight with the bear, did a mysterious humanoid figure swoop in and rescue you, only to disappear in to the woods, never to be seen again? Now you can put that on a map!

The Bigfoot Tracking map combines the highly sophisticated technology of Leaflet.js, an Express Server, and several geese to deliver the greatest Bigfoot Tracking map of all, ever. 

In this map, you-- yes you!-- can add pins of your own Bigfoot sightings. Simply find your location on the map, click it, and describe your encounter. Don't worry if you don't have a photo, Bigfoot eludes us all and our map will kindly provide a photo for you. 

If you have seen Bigfoot in an entirely different area than our default maps provide, don't fret! With the Bigfoot Tracking map, it is possible to create more maps for location specific Bigfoot encounters. 

This map was made as a midterm project for the [Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp](https://lighthouselabs.ca), and was created by Charlee Perrier (@charleenmperrier), Kevin Liao (@Kevinliao0857), and Molly Trepanier (@mollyet).
